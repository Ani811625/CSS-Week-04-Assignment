    <h1>PW SKILLS</h1>
    <p>Proficiency in password management skills is essential in today's digital age, where online security and privacy
        are paramount. These skills encompass creating and maintaining strong, unique passwords for various online
        accounts and services. It also includes employing secure password storage practices, such as using reputable
        password managers to securely store and organize passwords. Understanding the importance of two-factor
        authentication (2FA) and using it whenever possible is another key aspect of password management skills. By
        staying informed about the latest security best practices and regularly updating and reviewing passwords,
        individuals can safeguard their online identities and sensitive information from potential threats and breaches,
        making password management skills a fundamental component of responsible digital citizenship.
